**Problem Statement:**

The department currently relies on the Signal application for daily communication and dissemination of business metrics, including actual vs. target figures and other important updates. Signal, however, can only be accessed via personal mobile phones due to company policy, and not on laptops.

The team is tasked with generating snapshots of data using conditional formatting in Excel. This process involves creating the visual representation on a laptop, capturing the screenshot, emailing it to a phone, and then sharing it on Signal. 

This workflow, from downloading raw data to updating formulas in Excel, creating conditional formatting, capturing screenshots, and finally emailing and sharing on Signal, is exceedingly time-consuming and inefficient.
